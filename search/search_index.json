MongoDB \uf0c1 MongoDB is a crucial dependency for MAS core services, if not scaled properly MongoDB can quickly become bottleneck as the number of concurrent users increases. A common symptom of an undersized MongoDB cluster is liveness probe timeouts and pod restarts of the MAS core services which depend on MongoDB (e.g. coreidp). For useful MongoDB troubleshooting commands see MongoDB Troubleshooting Key MongoDB metrics to monitor \uf0c1 The following MongoDB metrics are important to monitor Memory utilization: by default MongoDB will attempt to cache the active data set in memory (in the WiredTiger cache). If there are a large number of cache evictions or the mongod servers are oomkilled these can be indicators that the memory allocation is too small. Consider increasing the memory allocated to mongod server. CPU utilization: check that the mongod servers have not reached their allocated cpu limit Average read/write latency: average read and write latency should be under 50 milliseconds. If not it could be due to an undersized MongoDB cluster. Check that the MongoDB cluster has sufficient memory allocation and check disk performance. Lock waiters: a large number of lock waiters indicates contention on collections/documents in MongoDB Tip When using the ibm.mas_devops collection to install MAS you can optionally install Grafana with the cluster_monitoring ansible role . Once Grafana is installed via the cluster_monitoring ansible role you can then install MongoDB using the mongodb ansible role .

HTTP messaging support was added to MAS IoT for low volume scenarios and is not designed to be used for message rates greater than 1K msgs/sec. MQTT message ingest rates are 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than HTTP. The primary reason being that HTTP messaging requires a TLS handshake and authentication on every message published. The authentication requires a database lookup for the device authentication token. As such, HTTP messaging puts a strain on the authentication service and the IoT database. In order to achieve high data ingest rates with MAS IoT service, use the MQTT protocol and keep the device connection open while publishing messages. Best practice messaging pattern \uf0c1 MQTT CONNECT MQTT PUBLISH (in loop until all messages are published) Messaging Anti-pattern \uf0c1 MQTT CONNECT MQTT PUBLISH MQTT DISCONNECT MQTT CONNECT MQTT PUBLISH MQTT DISCONNECT ... Data Ingest rates, devices, and connections \uf0c1 The MQTT service in MAS IoT was designed to handle many device connections, each publishing at low rates. As such, when designing a data ingest application for MAS IoT it should distribute the load over many MQTT devices or applications in order to maximize message rates. Single device or application connections will be throttled based on the IoT Fair use policy (see below). IoT Fair Use Policy \uf0c1 IoT data ingest throttling limits are per device and are based on the device class (i.e. Device, Gateway, Application). These limits are in place to prevent DoS attacks from rogue (i.e. badly behaving) devices. The throttling limits do not scale with the MAS IoT deployment size. For more information on MAS IoT messaging quotas see https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/mapms/1_cloud?topic=features-quotas Messaging QoS \uf0c1 The messaging QoS specified when publishing an MQTT message also has a strong impact on messaging rates. QoS in order of fastest to slowest: QoS 0 - at most once (data loss possible, no message persistence or ACKs) QoS 1 - at least once (duplicates are possible, messages persisted and ACKed) QoS 2 - exactly once (application client required to maintain state, messages persisted and two phase commit between client/server) QoS >0 performance considerations requires disk persistence in MAS IoT messaging components and therefore disk I/O performance becomes critical with QoS >0. the MQTT specification provides a kind of protocol level flow control negotiation between client and server. The number of unacked messages allowed on the session is negotiated between client and server and if the client has no more available msg ids it must pause publishing until msg IDs become available. Msg IDs become available when messages ACKs are received. See MQTT spec for details: https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_QoS_1:_At Summary of factors that influence data ingestion rate \uf0c1 Choice of messaging protocol: MQTT (high volume) vs HTTP (low volume) Messaging Pattern: do NOT close MQTT sessions after each message published. leave connections open. Number of devices: Higher message rates are possible when the load is distributed over more connections Choice of device class: Fair use quotas are based on device class (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/mapms/1_cloud?topic=features-quotas)[https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/mapms/1_cloud?topic=features-quotas] Choice of QoS: high levels of messaging guarantees come with higher costs IoT Deployment \uf0c1 IoT CRD defines 3 default size deployments: dev, small, medium that controls the default settings for pod replics, cpu and memory. For production, medium is required. Sample yaml for medium deployment in IoT CR apiVersion : iot.ibm.com/v1 kind : IoT metadata : name : masinst1 namespace : mas-masinst1-iot spec : bindings : jdbc : system kafka : system mongo : system settings : deployment : size : medium If need to adjust the default setting for a deployment, go the iot-operator pod, then change the corresponding yaml files under /opt/ansible/roles/<ibm-iot-operator>/vars folder, e.g. /opt/ansible/roles/ibm-iot-actions/vars/size_medium.yml Connection and OpenShift Ingress Controllers \uf0c1 Openshift HAProxy supports 20k connection per pod. The total connection determinants how many end devices can connect to IoT MSProxy. By default, IBM ROKS deploys 3 router members that supports 3x20k = 60K connection By default, AWS ROSA deploys 2 router members that supports 2x20k = 40K connection use the below command to scale up to 3 router members: oc patch -n openshift-ingress-operator ingresscontroller/default --patch '{\"spec\":{\"replicas\": 3}}' --type=merge Kafka \uf0c1 IoT uses Kafka to process the messages.

It determines how fast the end devices can send the request. Message rate is limited by the message size and the bandwidth of ethernet network. To achieve higher rates and/or larger messages it will require a 10GB ethernet. The network bandwidth also impacts the response latency. The higher bandwidth, the lower latency.

When the DB server can no longer be scaled up, the customer should plan to create a new MAS instance and move sites to the new MAS instance which will be using a new DB server. Maximo Transaction latency \uf0c1 When describing Maximo transaction latency it is important to define the boundaries of what constitutes a standard or out-of-the-box Maximo transaction. The description below does just that. Terminology \uf0c1 CRUD refers to create, update, delete operations MBO stands for Maximo Business Objects (which are hierarchical in nature) Transaction latency is defined as the elapsed time between when the Maximo server receives the transaction request to the time when the Maximo server has sent the response. For UI users this also includes the elapsed time between when the Save button is clicked to when control is returned to the user. Definition of a transaction \uf0c1 An out of the box Maximo transaction is expected to complete with a latency of 2 seconds or less, where a transaction is defined as the creation, update, or deletion of a single MBO, containing no more than one child object and with no attachments or binary data (blobs). Example include, but are not limited to: Creation of a single WorkOrder object. This includes generation of the WorkOrderStatus and WorkOrderAncestor records. Update of a single WorkOrder object. For example, changing states from Approved to Closed. Deletion of a single WorkOrder object. Definition restrictions \uf0c1 The following conditions are considered to be outside the scope of an out of the box Maximo transaction, and therefore do not fall under the 2 second latency characterization. For UI initiated transactions this does not include latency incurred from downloading UI resources (e.g. js, css, png, jpg, etc.) It applies to out of the box Maximo applications, but not customized applications or out of the box Maximo applications with automation scripts It does not apply to UI initiated transactions with a large number of xhr requests (or portlets), for example the Maximo start center. Large here means greater than 2 xhr requests per page. Note, Maximo currently supports HTTP/1.1, so xhr requests initiated from a single user UI page are sequential, not concurrent. It does not apply to customized saved queries. It does not apply to bulk load requests. It does not apply to report related transactions App Server \uf0c1 MAS Manage has different bundle types e.g. All, UI, MEA, Report and CRON to configure app server. It is a best practice to isolate UI, CRON, MIF, and Report workloads on different server bundle types to reduce contention for resources within the same JVM/pod. Adjust the resource settings like cpu, memory, replica to match the workload. The settings are in ManageWorkspaces CR. Below is the sample. apiVersion : apps.mas.ibm.com/v1 kind : ManageWorkspace ... spec : settings : deployment : serverBundles : - bundleType : mea isDefault : false isMobileTarget : false isUserSyncTarget : true name : mea replica : 1 routeSubDomain : all - bundleType : cron isDefault : false isMobileTarget : false isUserSyncTarget : false name : cron replica : 1 ... spec : settings : resources : manageAdmin : limits : cpu : '2' memory : 4Gi requests : cpu : '0.2' memory : 500Mi serverBundles : limits : cpu : '6' memory : 10Gi requests : cpu : '0.2' memory : 1Gi Load-Balancer \uf0c1 Lab test shows roundrobin has more stable and better performance than leastconn policy which is the default. Follow this link to update load balancer policy. Manage Pod Functionality \uf0c1 Follow this link to understand the manage pod functionality. LTPA timeout \uf0c1 Using IBM Maximo Application Suite (MAS), Manage users will receive an error message saying to reload the application after 2 hours, even while actively working. This 2-hour timeout default is when the LTPA token in Manage expires, and is redirecting the user back to the login page for MAS. Follow Updating LTPA timeout in Manage to increase the default value. WebSphere Liberty \uf0c1 Due to the architecture change, Maximo 8.x (MAS Manage app) is deployed on WebSphere Liberty Base 21.0.0.5 with OpenJ9. As of WebSphere Liberty 18.0.0.1, the thread growth algorithm is enhanced to grow thread capacity more aggressively to react more rapidly to peak loads. For many environments, this autonomic tuning provided by the Open Liberty thread pool works well with no configuration or tuning by the operator. If necessary, you can adjust coreThreads and maxThreads value by tuning liberty . Configure JVM options in Manage app \uf0c1 Follow this link to configure JVM options DB \uf0c1 Disk \uf0c1 disk performance is critial for db performance. Recommend a storage or disk with disk throughput: > 250 MB/s IOPS: 10 IOPS/GB to 100 IOPS/GB (depending on volume size) To measure disk performance on Linux use the dd command. The sample command below measures disk performance of the data volume inside a db2 pod running in OCP CAUTION Make sure that ddtest filename is appended to the end of the data path or the dd command will wipe the db2 data directory.

Confirm latency is below 50ms by conducting a ping test. For production env, strongly recommend keeping the latency below 10ms and having app and db server in the same network segment. In cloud deployment scenarios, ensure both the database and OpenShift cluster are located within the same region, with the possibility of being in the same availability zone (AZ). Utilize the ping command to evaluate and pinpoint latency issues. Large table optimization \uf0c1 When optimizing large tables in the Manage app, it is recommended to transfer these tables to a dedicated tablespace on high-throughput disks, coupled with a dedicated buffer cache for enhanced performance. The speed of the disks and the availability of memory play crucial roles in this optimization strategy. Additionally, ensure that index statistics are regularly updated, and address any problematic queries to further optimize the system. DB - DB2/DB2wh \uf0c1 DB2 Tuning in Maximo 7.6.x Best practice is applicable. IMPORTANT The containerized DB2U and DB2WH deployments do NOT support text search (Regular DB2 has text search). As a result, some queries may perform poorly on containerized DB2 relative to Oracle DB and SQL Server, which both support text search. Searching records by Description on the list page is a typical scenario whose performance can benefit from text search capability of the database, especially if no other indexed attributes are included in the query. Adding a non-unique index on Description can help if an exact search can be made (Maximo search type = EXACT or user types is \"=\" before the search string, eg =Text) or the search can be done based on the beginning of the string (user types '%' at end of the string, eg Text%). If possible, adding other fields to the query (either by user typing them or as part of the default, where those attributes are part of an index can also help. In addition, adding Description to the end of one of these indexes can also show improvement. Highlights: increase maxsequence cache to 50 run runstats and/or reorg to update index periodically separate system storage, user storage, backup storage, transaction logs storage, temporary tablespace storage on different disks if possible. Use DB2 Performance Diagnosis to troubleshoot and tuning the db and SQL. Manage requires row-organized tables. Check db2w db setting (by default it uses column based) and update the setting by db2 update db cfg using DFT_TABLE_ORG ROW Manage does NOT support MMP or table partition in the current version, but consider to archive records over 1-year old. Optim is the one of the tools can be used for archiving. see this guide and this video for details. Increase the concurrently running statements allowed for a DB2 application. This issue occcurs when loading a large amount of data via MIF or api call. See this link for the tuning. storageclass for ibm cloud: performance block storage (custom or gold, depending on volume size), block silver for backup for aws cloud: if using EFS for db, consider Provisioned mode to have a constant throughput. For more disk options, see details in this page For db2 registry (db2set): Set db2_workload=maximo . That makes db cfg variable WLM_ADMISSION_CTRL is set to NO Do NOT change the default values for DB2_OVERRIDE_NUM_CPUS and DB2_OVERRIDE_THREADING_DEGREE . Verify db2 db cfg variable WLM_ADMISSION_CTRL is set to NO For db2ucluster CR Do NOT set db2 instance memory. The operator will automatically calculate it based on the container memory limit. (Optional) for performance stability, set the same value to both container resource request and limit. For db2 monitor switches The best practice is turn off all monitor switches except the Timestamp in dbm cfg. If turn on monitor switches in dbm cfg, will cause monitor switches are turned on by default for all DB2 sessions, this will bring 5%-10% overhead on the overall database performance, depends on the workload and database server hardware spec. So we should not turn on monitor switches in dbm cfg. When we need to take DB2 monitor data, we should only turn on monitor switches in a specific session by the following command: db2 update monitor switches using BUFFERPOOL on LOCK on SORT on STATEMENT on TIMESTAMP on TABLE on UOW on And turn off all monitor switches immediately after getting required monitor data by the following command: db2 update monitor switches using BUFFERPOOL off LOCK off SORT off STATEMENT off TIMESTAMP off TABLE off UOW off DB - Oracle \uf0c1 Maximo 7.6.x Best practice is applicable DB - MSSQL \uf0c1 Maximo 7.6.x Best practice is applicable additional settings for MSSQL Server 2019 compatibility level: if maximo db is upgraded from the old version and the performance degradation is observed after the upgrade, consider to set compatibility level to the old version to keep the execution plan same. isolation level: ALTER DATABASE < DB NAME > SET ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION ON ALTER DATABASE < DB NAME > SET READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT ON recommend to place tempdb on dedicated fast disks.

For example, to inference a batch of 10 or more work orders will result in an average inferencing time of 20 milliseconds per work order in the predictor pod, but the inference time for a single work order from the UI is about 120 milliseconds (in the predictor pod). The total time including the MAS Manage API request is about 750 milliseconds. It is therefore much more efficient to inference large numbers of work orders asynchronously using the AIINFJOB cron task and a page size of 500. In other words, don't use the API from a script.","title":"PCC model inferencing: batch cron processing vs on-demand single inference"},{"location":"mas/manage/woi-train/","text":"Work Order Intelligence Training \uf0c1 This was added to the MAS Manage application to assist users with problem code classification (PCC) for Work Orders. See the product documentation for more details. PCC model training required resources \uf0c1 Model training is resource intensive. For this reason there is a limit of one active model training per MAS Manage instance. A single model training requires at least 8GB of memory. The pipeline pod, where model training occurs, will allocate a number of busy processes equal to the number of CPU on the worker node where the pod is scheduled. At the time of this writing there is no CPU limit set for the pipeline pod, so it will consume as much CPU resources as are available on the worker node where it is scheduled. In general, the more CPU is available to the pipeline pod the faster training time will go. The three data points on the graph below were taken on a 16 CPU worker node. In the tests below a cpu limit was placed on the pipeline pod (not the default, i.e. by default the pipeline pod does not have specified limits). As you can see the training time with an 8 CPU limit was a little more than twice as fast as the training time with a 4 CPU limit. However, when comparing the 16 CPU limit and 8 CPU limit training time, there is very little improvement. This can be attributed to the fact that there were other workloads running on the worker node where the pipeline pod was scheduled and as well as synchronization waits between the training processes/threads. In other words, to improve the training time for the 16 cpu limit test it would be necessary to schedule the pipeline pod on a worker node with more than 16 CPU and fewer competing workloads. Sample sizes for PCC model training \uf0c1 Important Do not train with more than 10K labeled samples. 10K samples is the recommended limit for PCC training. The training times for a single epoch and different sample sizes are shown below. In general, the larger the size of the labeled sample data set, the longer the training time will be. You can see below there is an exception to this rule. When comparing the single epoch training time between the 1K sample size and the 5K sample size, you can see that the single epoch training time for 5K sample size is only 82 minutes compared to 220 minutes for the 1K sample size. This is due to the fact that there were 30 problem codes in this test and with 1K sample size there were an insufficient number of samples per problem code. As a result, the model leveraged Watson X to generate synthetic samples and this process accounts for the additional training time for the 1K sample set.

For a real training, 12 epochs is used and therefore the single epoch training times below should be multiplied by 12 to get the real training time.

This correlation suggests that the level of transactional activity directly impacts the IO workload on the database disk. Conversely, the IO workload acts as a limitation on the system's ability to handle a larger volume of transactions. When IO is not the limiting factor, increasing the number of MEA Pods can positively impact the processing performance. Increasing the Message-Driven Bean (MDB) instances can potentially have a positive impact on system performance. It is recommended to adjust the number of records per message, the # of MDB and the batch size. By finding the right balance, you can target a resource usage of around 2 cores and 4-7GB of RAM that can help ensure efficient utilization without overburdening the MEA pods. Based on the lab results, it has been observed that a large number of internal error messages have a substantial impact on processing throughput. Under a certain circumstance, the configuration parameter mxe.int.splitdataonpost does not demonstrate a positive impact. To validate its effectiveness, it is recommended to perform a dry run in your specific environment for verification. Performance Troubleshooting Checklist \uf0c1 To troubleshoot and optimize performance, follow this checklist: Ensure adherence to best practices for optimizing performance in your DB, Openshift, and MAS environments. Monitor disk IO utilization of the database and maintain it within acceptable limits to avoid performance degradation due to saturated disk resources. Adjust the number of records per message and the MDB/batch size to effectively manage resource utilization of MEA pods. Aim for a resource consumption range of approximately 2 cores and 4-7 GB. Regularly check the message queue to prevent it from becoming empty, ensuring a steady flow of messages for processing. Minimize the occurrence of integration error messages as they can significantly impact processing throughput. Pay attention to a high volume of internal error messages and investigate the message reprocessing application for further insights. Set a sufficiently large value for maxMessageDepth to avoid message queue overflow. It is recommended to match SIBus's default value of at least 500,000. When the need for additional MEA pods arises, consider scaling up the number of worker nodes to accommodate the increased demand effectively. Test Methodologies \uf0c1 Establish a monitoring system to track essential performance metrics throughout the testing process. Begin with a dry run using a single MEA pod to establish a baseline benchmark for performance evaluation. Adjust the Message-Driven Bean (MDB) and BatchSize parameters to optimize resource utilization within an appropriate range for the MEA pod. Scale up the number of MEA pods as needed to meet performance requirements and accommodate increased workload. Continuously monitor and assess the performance of both the database and the application to identify any bottlenecks or areas for improvement.

Scale up ingress controller command: oc patch -n openshift-ingress-operator ingresscontroller/default --patch '{\"spec\":{\"replicas\": 3}}' --type=merge Max Connection \uf0c1 One of the most important tunable parameters for HAProxy scalability is the maxconn parameter. The router can handle a maximum number of 20k concurrent connections by using oc adm router --max-connections=xxxxx . This parameter will be impacted by node settings sysctl fs.nr_open and sysctl fs.file-max . HAproxy will not start if maxconn is high, but node setting is low. Note: OpenShift Container Platform no longer supports modifying Ingress Controller deployments by setting environment variables such as ROUTER_THREADS, ROUTER_DEFAULT_TUNNEL_TIMEOUT, ROUTER_DEFAULT_CLIENT_TIMEOUT, ROUTER_DEFAULT_SERVER_TIMEOUT, and RELOAD_INTERVAL. You can modify the Ingress Controller deployment, but if the Ingress Operator is enabled, the configuration is overwritten. Load Balance Algorithm \uf0c1 Starting from OCP 4.10, there have been four load-balancing algorithms available: source, roundrobin, random, and leastconn . The default algorithm is set to random . In earlier versions of OCP, before 4.10, there were three load-balancing algorithms: source, roundrobin, and leastconn . The default algorithm in those versions was leastconn . Set up annotations for each route to change the default algorithm if needed. e.g. haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance=roundrobin Master and Worker Nodes Consideration \uf0c1 There are a wide selection instance types that comprise varying combinations of CPU, memory, disk and network. Below are a few considerations: Each worker node will reserve about 1 core for internal services. In order to avoid the side effect of overcommit, 16core/64G is a good starting type for a normal worker node. A 8-core instance may not have insufficent capacity while 32-core instance may lose a big cluster capacity due to an outage or failure. Using balanced CPU-memory worder nodes typically fits our work load -the ratio of CPU to memory is 1 to 4. An instance with a higher memory/cpu ratio e.g. 8:1 is recommended for database nodes. The number of worker nodes >=3. This will give a high availability needing a smaller built in redundant capacity. For the product env, a 8core/32G is recommended for master nodes to avoid any bottleneck for the internal services. An instance with 10GB ethernet is strongly recommended for the production env. A minimum of 300GB storage per worker node is strongly recommended to accommodate MAS app build process requirements.

Here are additional details: WebSphere Liberty \uf0c1 As of WebSphere Liberty 18.0.0.1, the thread growth algorithm is enhanced to grow thread capacity more aggressively so as to react more rapidly to peak loads.

When -Xmx is set, -XX:MaxRAMPercentage will be ignored. -XX:+UseContainerSupport/-XX:-UseContainerSupport If -XX:+UseContainerSupport is set, it allows to change the InitialRAMPercentage and MaxRAMPercentage values. -Xms and -Xmx can overwrite the limits. -Xmn (Nursery Space) Setting the size of the nursery when using this policy can be very important to optimize performance. 25 - 33% of total heap is recommended. Please note manage pod limited memory is 10G that is not Total heap size. Heap size is based on (-Xmx or -XX:MaxRAMPercentage) setting. 10G also includes memory used by websphere for cache, compilation as well maximo mmi container. -Xgcthreads4 This parameter is used to set the number of threads that the Garbage Collector uses for parallel operations. By default, it is set to n -1 in OpenJ9 where n is the number of reported cpu on the node. You might want to restrict the number of GC threads used by each VM to reduce some overhead. -XcompilationThreads4 This parameter is used to specify the number of compilation threads that are used by the JIT compiler. Same as gcthread, you might want to restrict the number of compilation threads used by each VM to reduce some overhead. -Xshareclasses this parameter is used to share class data between running VMs, which can reduce the startup time for a VM once the cache has been created. \u2011Xdisableexplicitgc (Recommended) This parameter is used to disabling explicit garbage collection disables any System.gc() calls from triggering garbage collections. For optimal performance, disable explicit garbage collection. -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true/-Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=false For performance reasons, Maximo recommends to set this property to true.
